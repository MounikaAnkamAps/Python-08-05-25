1. Create and Print Variables
    Create variables of different types:
     
     name = "John"
     age = 25
     height = 5.9
     is_student = True
     Ask students to print each variable and its type using type().

    print(name, type(name))
    print(age, type(age))
    print(height,type(height))
    print(is_student ,type(is_student))

   
2. Change Value and Type
    Assign a number to a variable, then change it to a string. Print the value and type before and after.

     a = 10
     print(a,type(a))
     a = "ten"
     print(a,type(a))
     

3. Guess the Type

    Give a list of values and ask students to guess the datatype before using type() to check:

     10--Number, 
     3.14--Float,
     "hello"--String,
     True--Boolean
     

4. Variable Naming Practice
    Ask students to create variables with meaningful names:

      A variable for a studentâ€™s name
      --Student_name="Mounika"
      A variable for exam marks
      --Exam_marks=50
      A variable for pass/fail status
      --Result=pass

5. Identify Errors
    Give wrong variable assignments and ask them to correct:

     1name = "Alice"      # Invalid
     my-age = 20          # Invalid
     print(Name)          # NameError
     

6. Simple Story with Variables
    Ask students to write a mini-story using variables:

     hero = "Spider-Man"
     villain = "Green Goblin"
     city = "New York"
     print(hero, "saved", city, "from", villain)
     

7. Swap Values

    Create two variables and swap their values:

     python
     a = 5
     b = 10
     print(a,b)
     a,b=b,a
     print(a,b)
